        Inherited forms of cardiomyopathy, including hypertrophic (HCM) and
        dilated (DCM), are among the most common Mendelian diseases and are
        associated with risk for sudden cardiac death. HCM alone is the leading
        cause of sudden nontraumatic death in young adults. Although a number of
        genes have been identified for these disorders, the cause of over half
        of cases remain unknown even after comprehensive testing. In addition,
        congenital heart malformations are the most common birth defect and the
        most common cause of infant death, yet only 20% are diagnosable with
        known genetic causes.

        Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are characterized by progressive
        dysfunction and death of rod and cone photoreceptor cells, leading to
        vision loss, and are one of the most genetically diverse groups of
        inherited disorders. Identifying the genetic cause of patientsâ€™ IRD has
        become especially important with the success of gene therapy trials. The
        specific genetic cause remains elusive in half of IRD patients,
        indicating many gene discoveries remain.
