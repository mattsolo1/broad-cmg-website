  title: Our Mission
  description: >-
    The goal of the CMG program is to discover new genes that underlie Mendelian
    diseases. To that end, our Center applies large-scale genomic methods -
    exome, whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing - to thousands of
    undiagnosed rare disease families. Our approach to gene discovery is
    characterized by deep interactions between our informatics team and clinical
    collaborators, using a secure online analysis platform, seqr, and by rapid
    and open sharing of resources and data with the wider rare disease
    community.

        Inherited forms of cardiomyopathy, including hypertrophic (HCM) and
        dilated (DCM), are among the most common Mendelian diseases and are
        associated with risk for sudden cardiac death. HCM alone is the leading
        cause of sudden nontraumatic death in young adults. Although a number of
        genes have been identified for these disorders, the cause of over half
        of cases remain unknown even after comprehensive testing. In addition,
        congenital heart malformations are the most common birth defect and the
        most common cause of infant death, yet only 20% are diagnosable with
        known genetic causes.

        Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are characterized by progressive
        dysfunction and death of rod and cone photoreceptor cells, leading to
        vision loss, and are one of the most genetically diverse groups of
        inherited disorders. Identifying the genetic cause of patients’ IRD has
        become especially important with the success of gene therapy trials. The
        specific genetic cause remains elusive in half of IRD patients,
        indicating many gene discoveries remain.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
