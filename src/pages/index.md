  title: Our Mission
  description: >-
    The goal of the CMG program is to discover new genes that underlie Mendelian
    diseases. To that end, our Center applies large-scale genomic methods -
    exome, whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing - to thousands of
    undiagnosed rare disease families. Our approach to gene discovery is
    characterized by deep interactions between our informatics team and clinical
    collaborators, using a secure online analysis platform, seqr, and by rapid
    and open sharing of resources and data with the wider rare disease
    community.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
